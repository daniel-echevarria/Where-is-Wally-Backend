## 📚 Introduction

**Where's Waldo** is a fun and interactive web app inspired by the classic *"Where's Waldo?"* books. In this project, users search for Waldo and other characters in a challenging and colorful image. It showcases my skills in web development, including front-end interactivity with **React**, backend functionality using **Ruby on Rails**, and overall project design.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can click on characters in the image to identify them.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Immediate confirmation when characters are found or when a wrong selection is made.
- **Leaderboard**: Keeps track of the fastest players.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The goal is to find **Waldo** and other hidden characters as quickly as possible.
2. Clicking on a character reveals a dropdown to select their identity.
3. If the selection is correct, the character is marked as found.
4. The user's time is displayed, and they can enter their name on the podium if they are one of the **3 fastest players**.
