## Introduction

Where's Waldo is a fun and interactive web app inspired by the classic "Where's Waldo?" books. In this project, users search for Waldo and other characters in a challenging and colorful image. This project showcases my skills in web development, including front-end interactivity with React, backend functionality using Ruby on Rails, and overall project design.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can click on characters in the image to identify them.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Immediate confirmation when characters are found or when a wrong selection is made.
- **Leaderboard**: Keeps track of the fastest players.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## How It Works

1. The goal is to find Waldo and the other hidden characters as quickly as possible.
2. Clicking on a character reveals a dropdown to select their identity.
3. If the selection is correct, the character is marked as found.
4. The user's time is display and the user can enter is name on the podium if he is part of the 3 fastest players.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance responsiveness to work better on different screen sizes.
- Add more levels with different images and characters.
- Implement hints to make the game more accessible.
